# Scene
> Scene class, contains concept below 

## main 
### Spatial data stuctures
> Implement efficient spatial data structures, such as octrees, BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy), or k-d trees, to manage and organize objects within the scene. These structures can help improve performance in tasks like collision detection, culling, and raycasting.



### Material and texture management
> Create systems for handling materials and textures that allow users to easily define and apply various properties, such as colors, reflectivity, transparency, and normal maps. Consider implementing a material library and texture caching system for better performance and ease of use.

### Picking and selection: 
> Implement a picking system that allows users to interact with objects in the scene, such as selecting or dragging objects. This can be achieved using techniques like raycasting or color-based picking.

### Customizability: 

> Design the scene class to be flexible and customizable, allowing users to modify the rendering pipeline, culling strategies, or other internal processes to suit their specific needs.

### Event handling: 

> Implement an event system that allows users to register and respond to events, such as object addition, removal, or updates within the scene.

### Loading and serialization: 

> Provide functionality for loading and saving scene data from various file formats, such as JSON, glTF, or OBJ. This can include handling asynchronous loading and displaying loading progress indicators.

### Renderer integration: 
> Design the scene class to be compatible with multiple rendering backends, such as WebGL, WebGPU, or even software rendering. This can help your library to be more versatile and future-proof.

### Debugging tools: 
> Implement debugging and visualization tools to help users identify and resolve issues in their scenes, such as displaying bounding volumes, wireframes, or frame rate counters.

### Scene optimization: 
> Provide automated tools or guidelines for optimizing scenes, such as merging geometry, simplifying meshes, or compressing textures.

### Multi-scene management: 
Design the scene class to support multiple scenes, either rendered concurrently or independently. This can be useful for implementing features like overlays, mini-maps, or rendering to texture.
